<p class="text-l">Slate is a small front end framework for building reusable interfaces.</p>
<p class="doc-note">Slate is under heavy internal developement. Breaking changes will occur as the api is finalized.</p>
<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of slate is to expand traditional css frameworks by providing a robust set of ui components. All components are defined with html and css only to avoid javascript dependance, making them highly reusable. Each piece is designed to have clear usage patterns and to be as modular as possible. You should be able to install one compoment without 120kb of scaffolding.</p>
